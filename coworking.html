        <h3>Co-working project</h3>
        <p>
          Design and preliminary project of a co-working in San Juan, Puerto Rico.<br>
          for Nifty Reno LLC, 2019.
        </p>

        <p>The project transformed an old divided office level into an open and dynamic co-working space. Different
          configurations of work spaces were thought with the use of mobile elements, office systems, work and
          recreation modules. It does not present large architectural structures, but rather open structures were chosen.</p>
