              Research on the creation and use of materials formed from the growth of living organisms. To create this biomaterial,
              mycelium of the fungus Ganoderma Lucidum, was used. This organism has the natural capacity to fuse and transform different
              typologies of organic substrates. From this theoretical/practical research, various formal possibilities of the material
              were explored, making different pieces by means of digital manufacturing tools.<br>
              The aim was to understand the possibilities of the material.
