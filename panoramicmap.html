              This panoramic view shows the geomorphology and vegetation that can be seen from the eastern slope of the Rittisberg slope. These elements, which are key points in understanding the unique features of the view, can go unnoticed by the visitor. This map can be an education tool to enhance the visitor's experience by providing a detailed guide to the notable landmarks, geological formations, and diverse flora and fauna that contribute to the breathtaking scenery.From a design perspective, the idea was to make it non real. The reality, for us, is already in front of the visitors' eyes. So, our task was to make it simple but at the same time, to have some recognizable features for the visitor to understand what we are talking about.
