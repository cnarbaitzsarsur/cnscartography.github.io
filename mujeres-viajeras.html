        <h3>Mujeres viajeras</h3>
        <p>
          This project was born out of the #30daymapchallenge. It was meant to be a compilation of women travelers and their adventures. But as I dug into the stories, I found that many women were traveling for reasons beyond leisure—facing displacement, war, and even braving long distances just to access water.
          The collection became a narrative of resistance, a way to fight against the invisibility of these women's struggles. I quickly realized that each narrative deserved more than the limited time frame of the challenge. As a result, my map series didn't hit the 30-map mark. But it did become something more meaningful—a deeper look into the diverse and challenging journeys of women around the world.
          Project for the #30daymapchallenge, 2022.
