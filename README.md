Hello! 

I did this website having in mind to create a simple code for my portfolio.
I wanted to create it myself to use as much as open source options.
And to have the posibility to improve it in the future, if needed.

You can take the code and use for your own portfolio. Let me know if you do it, I would love to see the results!
