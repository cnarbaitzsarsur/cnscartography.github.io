              I was asked to write an article for Katapult, a German magazine known for using social science statistics and studies to create simplified, detailed graphics. I chose to focus on cars—what else for a German magazine?! My article explores how the second-hand car industry distributes old vehicles globally. In an effort to promote new, low-emission cars, large numbers of older cars are discarded and exported abroad. According to a study by the UN Environment Program (UNEP), up to 80% of used cars exported don’t meet the minimum safety and environmental standards in their countries of origin, raising serious concerns about the environmental and safety impacts of this global trade.
